Playing with libgdx to create a match3 game

I created a project just to try out and learn about libgdx. The project structure is based on https://github.com/saznetro/snake, 
the credit goes to nukesz(https://github.com/nukesz) for that.


I have used a free song from this site: http://incompetech.com/, the credit goes to Kevin MacLeod. The music title: Laser Groove .
